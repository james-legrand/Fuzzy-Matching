## Fuzzy matching tool

A GUI-based tool for fuzzy string matching using RapidFuzz, developed using CustomTkinter. Taking as input two datasets of strings to match, this tool returns a cleaned dataset containing match scores according to the specified algorithm and output type.

Supports matching across multiple datasets, and preprocessing for non-ASCII characters.

#### Works in progress:
- Support threshold and best match with multi matching
- Return top n results (using process extract)
